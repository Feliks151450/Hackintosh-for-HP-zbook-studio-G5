# HP ZBOOK G5 STUDIO EFI
This laptop makes a pretty good hackintosh and supports next to all features, I'm still working on it. It's reliable so far and got good battery life. 

# What works
 1. Supporting MacOS 12
 2. i7 8750H & UHD630 with 2560MB VRAM
 3. Brightness controls
 4. USB type A ports (2.0 & 3.0)
 5. Native NVRAM r/w
 6. cAVS audio with internal speakers & audio jack
 7. Intel Bluetooth, able to toggle on/off
 8. Intel WiFi, able to connect 2.4G and 5G WiFi
 9. I2C Synaptics trackpad, up to 5 finger gestures
 10. PS2 keyboard, remappings through karabiner
 11. Battery management
 12. USB type C data and video
 13. Supporting Sidecar using type-c cable
# What doesn't
 1. Airdrop (works if repaced with suitable hardware)
 2. HDMI port (wired to NVIDIA, thus it's dead)
 3. Cardreader (sadly PCI and not USB, can't find drivers)
 4. Thunderbolt (got no devices to test, but hotplug is not patched yet)
# Notice
you need to set graphics in bios to UMA graphic, or the brightness controls and sleep can work well
